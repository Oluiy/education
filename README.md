# EduNerve MVP Backend Implementation

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is the complete backend implementation for EduNerve MVP - a multi-tenant educational SaaS platform. The backend provides comprehensive school management, user authentication, bulk data import, and parent communication via WhatsApp.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Service Architecture
- **Super Admin Service** (Port 8009): Platform-wide school management and analytics
- **Authentication Service** (Port 8001): Multi-tenant user authentication and authorization
- **Admin Service** (Port 8002): School administration and bulk user import
- **Notification Service** (Port 8003): Email, SMS, and WhatsApp communication

### Key Features
- ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation**: Each school operates in its own data space
- ✅ **Complete workflow**: Platform Admin → School Registration → Bulk Import → User Login → Parent Tracking
- ✅ **WhatsApp Integration**: Parent notifications via Termii API
- ✅ **Bulk Import**: CSV-based mass user creation with validation
- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Super Admin, School Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent roles
- ✅ **Platform Analytics**: Revenue tracking and school metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Termii API key (for WhatsApp)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd education

# Set up environment variables (copy from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and API credentials
```

### 2. Start All Services
```bash
# Linux/Mac
chmod +x start_services.sh
./start_services.sh start

# Windows
start_services.bat start
```

### 3. Verify Services
```bash
# Check service status
./start_services.sh status

# Run integration tests
./start_services.sh test
```

## 📊 Complete Workflow

The MVP implements this exact workflow as requested:

1. **Platform Admin Setup** → Super Admin Service manages platform
2. **School Registration** → New schools registered with primary admin
3. **Bulk User Import** → CSV import for students, teachers, parents
4. **User Authentication** → Multi-tenant login with school isolation
5. **Parent WhatsApp Tracking** → Automated notifications for attendance, grades, fees

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/edunerve_db

# Services
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8001
ADMIN_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8002
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8003
SUPER_ADMIN_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8009

CREATE DATABASE edunerve_db;

-- Create user
CREATE USER edunerve_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE edunerve_db TO edunerve_user;
```

## 📝 API Documentation

Once services are running, access API documentation:
- **Super Admin API**: http://localhost:8009/docs
- **Auth API**: http://localhost:8001/docs
- **Admin API**: http://localhost:8002/docs
- **Notification API**: http://localhost:8003/docs

## 🧪 Testing

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run complete workflow test
python integration_test.py

# Individual service tests
cd services/super-admin-service
python -m pytest tests/

# All services status
./start_services.sh status
```

### Sample Test Workflow
1. Creates test school "MVP Test School"
2. Bulk imports 3 students, 3 teachers, 3 parents
3. Tests multi-tenant authentication for each role
4. Sends WhatsApp notifications to parents
5. Generates comprehensive report

## 🔐 Security Features

- Automatic dependency installation

### Docker Support
```bash
# Build service images
docker build -t edunerve-super-admin services/super-admin-service/
docker build -t edunerve-auth services/auth-service/

docker build -t edunerve-notification services/notification-service/

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexes
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Background Tasks**: Async processing for bulk operations
- **Caching**: Redis integration for session management
- **Load Balancing**: Service isolation enables horizontal scaling

alembic upgrade head

# Backup database
pg_dump edunerve_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service won't start**: Check port availability and dependencies
2. **Database connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL and PostgreSQL status
3. **WhatsApp not sending**: Validate Termii API key and phone number format
4. **Import failing**: Check CSV format and required headers
